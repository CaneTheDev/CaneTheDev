Intro 101

Cane The Dev
Cane The Dev
Systems Engineer / Polyglot Builder

I build backend-heavy systems where reliability, performance, and failure modes actually matter, especially under real load.

Trading systems, real-time apps, AI pipelines, and polyglot backends.

What I Do
Design distributed systems that handle real traffic
Build native applications for Mobile (iOS/Android) and Desktop (Windows/Cross-platform)
Work end-to-end: architecture → implementation → deployment → failure analysis
Debug production issues involving concurrency, latency, and state
Automate workflows and tools that remove bottlenecks for teams
My work spans frontend, backend, data, and infrastructure, but my center of gravity is backend systems.

Most of my serious work lives in private repositories or production systems.

What I Build With
Over time, I've worked across many layers of the stack. I choose tools based on constraints, not trends.

Interfaces: Web, Mobile & Desktop
I don't just build web views. I build native clients when performance or OS integration matters.

Web: SolidJS, React, Vue.js

Mobile: Flutter, Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)

Desktop: C++ (Cross-platform), C# (Native Windows)

Backend & Systems
Most of my work lives here , services that handle concurrency, real traffic, and failure modes.

Rust, Go, Elixir (Phoenix), Node.js, Python

Data, Storage & Messaging
I've worked with both transactional and analytical workloads, choosing stores based on access patterns and scale.

PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite, Message Queues, File-based pipelines

AI & Machine Learning
I build AI-powered systems that solve real problems: speech recognition pipelines, trading bots with ML-driven strategies, and data analysis for production decisions.

Python (with its vast ML ecosystem), Kaggle (for GPU access)

Infrastructure & Delivery
I care about repeatability, observability, and knowing how systems fail.

Linux, Docker, CI pipelines, Cloud deployments

Tools change. Principles don't.

How I Work
I optimize for long-term system health, not short-term cleverness.

I use AI to accelerate implementation, not to replace judgment.

I write tests and simulations because production always finds edge cases.

I value readability first, performance second, cleverness last.

I ship incrementally and measure before optimizing.

I document decisions so future me (or teammates) can reason about them.
